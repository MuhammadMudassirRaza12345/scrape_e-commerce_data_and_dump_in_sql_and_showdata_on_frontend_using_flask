Task 2: Write queries using the ORG database we have used in class. [ 4 marks ]

ANS:1
SELECT  MAX(SALARY) As SECONDHighestSalary
FROM org.worker where SALARY < (SELECT  MAX(SALARY) FROM org.worker); 
  
ANS2:
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT SALARY, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY SALARY DESC) AS rn
  FROM worker
)
SELECT SALARY
FROM cte
WHERE rn = 5;

In this query, a common table expression (CTE) named cte is used to assign a unique row number (rn) to each salary in the employees table, based on its value
 in descending order. The row numbers and salaries are then stored in the CTE. Finally, the SELECT statement filters the CTE to return only the salary with a
 row number of 5, which is the 5th highest salary.
 




ANS3:
CREATE TABLE new_table SELECT * FROM bonus; 



ANS4:

SELECT *
FROM  org.worker 
where SALARY % 2 <> 0;
